Description: Visualization based signal analysis
 Sonic AWE is a signal analysis tool based on visualization that runs on GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Sonic AWE navigates large spectrums as map software navigates earth so you can seemlessly zoom in anywhere and scale the spectrum to focus on your points of interest. It is easy to change spectrum parameters and transform methods interactively. This workflow is intended to make it easy to understand signal components fast.
