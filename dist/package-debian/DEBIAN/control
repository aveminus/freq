 "Dependency is not satisfiable: libglew1.5, libportaudiocpp0, libhdf5-serial-1.8.4"
 
 Sonic AWE is built using several community developed open source libraries. In Ubuntu, some of these libraries (such as libglew1.5) are contained in the 'universe' repository. Enable settings->repositories->universe in synaptic and press the reload button in synaptic, then try installing this package again.
