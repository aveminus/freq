Debugging tests
---------------
It's quite easy to mix libraries built for debug with those built for release. So to debug a test, make sure sonicawe, gpumisc, your test, and sonicawe-end2end/common are built with debug symbols turned on.


Test execution environment
--------------------------
When running individual tests outside runtests.sh you need to make sure it can find required dynamic libraries. Either by changing the PATH in windows, LD_LIBRARY_PATH in Linux and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in OS X. This path can also be added to the "Run Environment" in Qt Creator or Visual C++ (remember to change the base path .../johan/dev/sonicawe above for Visual C++).
Like so:


os x
----
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-maclib/lib; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd):/usr/local/cuda/lib"
echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH


windows bash
------------
export PATH="$PATH:$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-winlib/sonicawe_snapshot_win32_base; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd)"
echo $PATH


windows cmd/visual c++
----------------------
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\johan\dev\sonicawe\lib\sonicawe-winlib\sonicawe_snapshot_win32_base;C:\Users\johan\dev\sonicawe\src\debug


ubuntu
------
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-ubuntulib/lib; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd)"
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Creating a new test
-------------------
Copy a previous test, rename the files correspondingly. Remove the .user file.


Developing tests in Qt Creator
------------------------------
Open sonicawe project.
Open "test project".

[The first time you open a Qt project in your build environment you need to setup the build and run configuration (this is stored in the .pro.user file which is individual and not committed)]
[tests in the tests/integration/4-sonicawe-end2end folder rely on a common project, open that as well]

Deselect to import build.
Create build configuration: For Each Qt Version One Debug And One Release.
Deselect shadow build.
Deselect Embedded Linux.
Click "Configure Project".
Go to the Projects->"Test project"->Dependencies and add a dependncy on the sonicawe project (and to the common project if this is an end2end test).
Select the build configuration for sonicawe to be debug testlib.

Configure run environment in Qt according to the instructions above.
