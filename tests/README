Debugging tests
---------------
It's quite possible to mix libraries built for debug with those built for release. So to debug a test, make sure sonicawe, gpumisc, your test, and sonicawe-end2end/common are built with debug symbols turned on.

For instance in mac, these commands (where 'yourtest' is your test) should ensure all libraries are built for debugging;

cd sonicawe
make distclean
qmake -r CONFIG+=debug CONFIG+=cpuonly -spec macx-g++ CONFIG+=testlib
make -j8
cd tests/integration/sonicawe-end2end
make distclean
qmake -r CONFIG+=debug CONFIG+=cpuonly -spec macx-g++
make -j8
cd yourtest
make distclean
qmake -r CONFIG+=debug CONFIG+=cpuonly -spec macx-g++
make -j8


When running individual tests outside runtests.sh you need to make sure it can find required dynamic libraries. Either by changing the PATH in windows, LD_LIBRARY_PATH in Linux and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in OS X. Like so:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(cd ../lib/sonicawe-maclib/lib; pwd):$(cd ../src; pwd):/usr/local/cuda/lib"
echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
This path can then be added to the "Run Environment" in Qt Creator.
