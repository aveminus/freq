*These steps will setup your development environment for Sonic AWE on Ubuntu 10.04 and possibly later versions of Ubuntu*
*1. Sonic AWE*
Make sure you have the public release of Sonic AWE up an running on your computer first. To make sure your computer can actually run the program to start with.

*2. Prerequisites*
*2.1. git installation*
Setup your git installation by following all of these steps: http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/
Once you've created your new pair of ssh keys send the public one to johan.gustafsson@muchdifferent.com and wait for him to give you access to the repository.

*2.1. Cuda*
Download and install the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html">cuda toolkit and devdrivers from nvidia</a> (advanced: the devdrivers are needed because they include 'libcuda.so'. If you don't need to run the program but want to compile it you can extract libcuda.so from the devdriver installation package with the flag -x).

Create link to nvidia cuda compiler (nvcc) in path, and set library path for Cuda:
<pre>

$ sudo su
$ ln -s /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc /usr/local/bin/nvcc
$ echo /usr/local/cuda/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
$ echo /usr/local/cuda/lib64 >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
$ ldconfig
$ exit

</pre>

*2.2. Packages from the Ubuntu repositories*
<pre>

$ sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev portaudio19-dev libglew1.5-dev freeglut3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-serialization-dev libqt4-dev qtcreator libhdf5-serial-dev
$ sudo apt-get install qgit build-essential colorgcc

</pre>

*3. Sonic Awe*
*3.1 Get source code*


<pre>

$ git clone http://jovia.net/sonic.git
$ cd sonic
$ git submodule update ----init
$ cd sonicawe; git pull origin master
$ cd ../gpumisc; git pull origin master
$ cd ..

</pre>

*3.2. Compile*
<pre>

$ qmake
$ make

</pre>

*3.3. Run*
<pre>

$ cd sonicawe
$ ./sonicawe

</pre>

*Development troubleshooting*
# The prefered workflow is to get the distributed binaries to work first, before starting developing. See the website for drivers and downloads.
