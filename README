Installation
============
A cuda-enabled graphics card is required, check this list if you are unsure about your own hardware
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html

Download binaries for your platform from
http://github.com/reep/sonicawe/downloads

You might also need to install cuda-compatible drivers
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html


Development setup
=================
For development on Ubuntu 9.10.

Send your public RSA key (http://help.github.com/linux-key-setup/) to sonicawe@reep.se.

Download and install the cuda toolkit from nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html).

Execute the following commands:
# set path and library path for Cuda
echo PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin >> ~/.bashrc
sudo echo /usr/local/cuda/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
sudo echo /usr/local/cuda/lib64 >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
sudo ldconfig

# install required packages
sudo apt-get install libaudiere-dev libsndfile1-dev libboost1.37-dev libqt4-dev qt-creator libglut-dev git

# download source code
git clone git@github.com:reep/sonic.git
cd sonic
git submodule update --init 

# compile
qmake
make


Get input data for Sonic Awe, small wav-files works well. Longer sounds require you to lower scales per octave, see ./run-sonicawe.sh --help.

# run Sonic AWE
cd sonicawe
./run-sonicawe.sh


Debugging in Qt Creator
=======================
Under Projects/Build Environment, add: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../misc


Troubleshooting
===============
1. Check that cuda is installed by downloading cuda sdk and compile all examples

When you run the examples it sais that no cuda compatible graphics card is found (and you known you've got one).
2. Install cuda drivers 
2.1 http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
2.2 Follow this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1125400

3. If you experience slow graphics, try disabling compiz if you're running it.


have fun
