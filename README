Read setup for notes on developing for Sonic AWE.


Installation
============
Download binaries for your platform from
http://github.com/gustafsson/sonicawe/downloads

A cuda-enabled graphics card is required, check this list if you are unsure about your own card
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html


Development setup
=================
For development on Ubuntu 9.10.

Download and install the cuda toolkit from nvidia
Add /usr/local/cuda/bin to your PATH
Add /usr/local/cuda/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf (or /lib64 if you're running a 64-bit system)

Install required packages
sudo apt-get install libaudiere-dev libsndfile1-dev libboost1.37-dev libqt4-dev qt-creator libglut-dev

Get the source to "sonicawe" from github.com:gustafsson/sonicawe.git
Get the source to "sonicawe misc" from github.com:gustafsson/misc.git

Troubleshooting
1. Check that cuda is installed by downloading cuda sdk and compile all examples

When you run the examples it sais that no cuda compatible graphics card is found (and you known you've got one).
2. Install cuda drivers 
2.1 http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
2.2 Follow this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1125400

3. If you experience slow graphics, try disabling compiz if you're running it.

have fun
