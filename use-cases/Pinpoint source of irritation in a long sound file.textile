h4. Business case: Analysis tool

# User listens to sound clip in SonicAWE (and watch the scalogram stream past)
# When at a passage of interest (annoying sound), user presses a key
# SonicAWE places a wave-format marker at the position
# Once sound is played through, user navigates to each marker using the timeline or a list
# User selects different time/frequency ranges until the point of interest is pinpointed
