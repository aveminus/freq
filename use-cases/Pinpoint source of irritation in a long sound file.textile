# Business case: Analysis tool

1. User listens to sound clip in SonicAWE (and watch the scalogram stream past)
2. When at a passage of interest (annoying sound), user presses a key
3. SonicAWE places a wave-format marker at the position
4. Once sound is played through, user navigates to each marker using the timeline or a list
5. User selects different time/frequency ranges until the point of interest is pinpointed
