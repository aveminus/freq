A signal is a composite of blobs.

# Locate the signalsâ€™ frequency blobs in scaleogram
# Click on a blob. (tonal component or a transient)
# A rough selection of the blob is generated by
## intensity based outline
## snakes
## boundary around local maximas
# Manually select more blobs
# Blobs in the same time span are *found* and grouped based on
## onset/offset
## overtone spacing
# If not satisfied manually include and exclude blobs
## clicking on blob to group/ungroup
## marking areas that should be excluded (and in effect any blobs in it)
