Backtraces rationale
====================
_The Backtrace class should store a backtrace of the call stack in 1 ms on OS X. Windows and linux was supported but are not currently maintained._

To make bugs go squish you want some sort of indication as to where it is. This is a bunch of small classes that makes use of runtime backtraces in C++ to decorate exceptions and segfaults with info about their origin. Each class header comment defines its expected behaviour.


#### Backtrace example ####

````cpp
string backtrace = Backtrace::make_string ();
cout << backtrace;
````

Example output (compiled with clang-500.2.79):

    backtrace (5 frames)
    Backtrace::make_string(int) (in backtrace-unittest) (backtrace.cpp:264)
    Backtrace::test() (in backtrace-unittest) (backtrace.cpp:283)
    BacktraceTest::UnitTest::test() (in backtrace-unittest) (unittest.cpp:34)
    start (in libdyld.dylib) + 1
    0x0000000000000001


#### PrettifySegfault example ####
_The PrettifySegfault class should attempt to capture any null-pointer exception (SIGSEGV and SIGILL) in the program, log a backtrace, and then throw a regular C++ exception from the function causing the signal._

````cpp
void nasty_function() {
  *(int*) NULL = 0;
}
````

Somewhere else

````cpp
    try {
      nasty_function();       
    } catch (const exception& x) {
      string backtrace_and_signal_name = boost::diagnostic_information(x);
    }
````

#### shared_state example ####
_The shared\_state\<T\> class is a smart pointer that guarantees thread-safe access to objects of type T._

Make an instance of an object thread-safe by storing it in a shared\_state smart pointer.

````cpp
    shared_state<MyType> a {new MyType};
    a->foo ();

    shared_state<const MyType> ac {a};
    ac->bar ();
````

The call to foo() will have mutually exclusive write access and the call to bar() will have shared read-only const access. Given

````cpp
    class MyType {
    public:
      void foo();
      void bar() const;
    };
````

To keep the lock over multiple method calls, do:

````cpp
    shared_state<MyType> a {new MyType};

    {
      auto w = a.write();
      w->foo();
      w->bar();
    }

    {
      auto r = a.read();
      r->bar();
      r->bar();
    }
````

.read() and .write() are implicitly called by the -> operator on shared_state and create thread-safe critical sections. For shared read-only access when using .read() and for mutually exclusive read-and-write access using .write(). They both throw exceptions on lock timeout, embed a backtrace in an exception object like this:

````cpp
#include "shared_state_traits_backtrace.h"

class MyType {
public:
    typedef shared_state_traits_backtrace shared_state_traits;
    ...
};


... {
  shared_state<MyType> a(new MyType);
  ...
  try {
    auto w = a.write();
    ...
  } catch (lock_failed& x) {
    const Backtrace* backtrace = boost::get_error_info<Backtrace::info>(x);
    ...
  }
... }
````

See shared\_state.pdf and shared\_state.h for details.

#### ExceptionAssert example ####
_The ExceptionAssert class should store details about an assertion that failed._

````cpp
    try {
         EXCEPTION_ASSERT_EQUALS( 1, 2 );
    } catch (const exception& x) {
         string what = boost::diagnostic_information(x);
    }
````

The .pro file for QMAKE builds a static library. The project depends on the boost library.

## Other utilities ##

- Demangle should perform a system specific demangling of compiled C++ names.
- The DetectGdb class should detect whether the current process was started through, or is running through, gdb (or as a child of another process).
- The Timer class should measure time with a high accuracy.
- The TaskTimer class should log how long time it takes to execute a scope while distinguishing nested scopes and different threads.
